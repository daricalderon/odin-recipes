    <h2>Steps to make a Delicious Rose Tteokbokki</h2>
    <p>Here's the step by step recipe:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine gochujang, sugar, soy sauce, and gochugaru in a small bowl. Mix them well and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In a heated pan, add the cooking oil, then onion, cabbage, and green onion. Stir fry them until lightly wilted, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low.</li>
        <li>Add the gochujang sauce mixture from Step 1, and stir well.</li>
        <li>Add the heavy cream and milk and stir until fully combined with the gochujang sauce for a smooth, creamy consistency.</li>
        <li>Add the rice cakes, fish cakes, and sausage to your pan. Then increase the heat to medium high so the sauce starts to boil. Stir often until the rice cakes have softened, being careful not to overcook them, as overcooked rice cakes can become mushy.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce is reduced and the other ingredients are evenly coated with it, sprinkle the cheese around the dish evenly. Give it a few moments to melt and produce a cheesy, creamy texture, then serve.</li>
    </ol>
