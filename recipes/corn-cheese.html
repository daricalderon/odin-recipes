    <h2>Steps to make Delicious Corn Cheese</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the sweet corn, bell peppers and the seasoning sauce in a bowl and mix them well.</li>
        <li>Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and melt it, then reduce the heat to low. Add the seasoned sweet corn and bell pepper mixture from Step 1 and gently spread it around the skillet.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the cheese and parsley flakes on top of the corn mixture and cover. Cook it further on the stove until the cheese is melted, about 4 to 5 minutes. Alternatively, you can cook it in the oven at 220°C (428°F) until the cheese is melted (approximately 5 minutes). Use the broiler/grill if you want to brown the cheese.</li>
